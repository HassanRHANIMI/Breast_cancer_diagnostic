--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

You are a data scientist working for a data analytics firm.  
                         
Your firm has tasked you to to create a classifier that can help diagnose patients.
it shoul classify a tumor as malignant or benign given its characterestics.
you will be using the Breast Cancer Wisconsin (Diagnostic) Dataset from scikit-learn.

Let's get started by downloading the data, then read through it to understand how
it could be handled. In a second phase, we'll start answering some basic questions to 
fully understand the data and finally choose a model to classify cancer tummors in two
classes : "Malignant" (positive class) and "benign" (negative class).
